<p>A <b>supercomputer</b> is a computer with a high level of computing performance compared to a <a href="/wiki/General-purpose_computer" class="mw-redirect" title="General-purpose computer">general-purpose computer</a>. Performance of a supercomputer is measured in <a href="/wiki/Floating-point" class="mw-redirect" title="Floating-point">floating-point</a> operations per second (<a href="/wiki/FLOPS" title="FLOPS">FLOPS</a>) instead of <a href="/wiki/Million_instructions_per_second" class="mw-redirect" title="Million instructions per second">million instructions per second</a> (MIPS).
